# Henderson–Hasselbalch
In chemistry and biochemistry, the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a chemical solution of a weak acid to the numerical value of the acid dissociation constant, Ka, of acid and the ratio of the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base in an equilibrium.
